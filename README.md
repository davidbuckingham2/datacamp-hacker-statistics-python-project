# DataCamp 'Hacker Statistics' Python Project

This GitHub repository contains code for a project on calculating your chances of winning a bet using 'hacker statistics'. The code utilizes numpy, random number generators, loops, and Matplotlib for visualization.

The project starts by generating random floats and simulating dice rolls using the NumPy library. It then demonstrates how to determine the next move based on the dice roll outcome. The code further explores generating random walks and visualizing them using line plots.

Additionally, the project introduces the concept of setting a lower limit to prevent the random walk from going below zero. It also implements a level of clumsiness that resets the step to zero with a certain probability. The code concludes by plotting the distribution of the final positions after multiple random walks.

By exploring and executing this code, I was able to gain insight into hacker statistics as well as practice using python tools for data science.
